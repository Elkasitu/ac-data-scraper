# Animal Crossing Data Scraper

This is a python script that scrapes data off of the (Animal Crossing FANDOM wiki)[https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Animal_Crossing_Wiki] and stores data relevant to collectibles (fish, insects, underwater items, ...) as XML as well as collectible images.

As of the current implementation, only fishes and more specifically, Animal Crossing New Horizons fishes are scrapable, but the goal is to be able to scrape all collectibles for all Animal Crossing versions.
